Mokom Bohris’s Cloud Services Project

Project Title
Using Cloud Services to Help Tailors Manage Customer Data in My Community

Project Description
This project explains how cloud services can be used to help tailors in my community manage customer information such as names, measurements, and clothing orders.

Many tailors still depend on notebooks to store customer details, which can easily be lost or damaged. This project proposes using simple cloud tools like Google Drive and Google Sheets to store data safely online.

The project discusses the problem, the proposed cloud-based solution, how it can be implemented in my community, the benefits, and the possible challenges.

Tools Mentioned
- Cloud storage services (Google Drive)
- Online spreadsheets (Google Sheets)
- Internet-enabled devices
